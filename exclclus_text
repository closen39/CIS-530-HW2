to create a reference design for low-cost , wireless-enabled digital media adapter and dvd player applications . 
the reference design is an advanced audio/video solution that is capable of wirelessly delivering a wide variety of content such as music , photos and movies from a windows pc , media gateway , or internet connection to a tv or audio system anywhere in the home . 
the design combines an atheros 802.11a/b/g chipset with super ag ( tm ) technology , an advanced digital media processor from ali corporation , and multimedia software from digital num into a low-cost reference design that will enable original design manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers to quickly bring to market a new class of low-cost digital media adapters and dvd players. 
atheros communications launches world 's first single-chip 802.11g access point device . 
atheros communications inc . 
announced the world 's first ieee 802.11g wireless access point on a chip , the atheros ar5006ap-g . 
the ar5006ap-g represents a breakthrough in system integration , combining the wireless network processor , media access controller ( mac ) , baseband and radio functions into a single silicon chip . 
atheros has also integrated many of the discrete components required by previous 802.11g access point designs . 
the transition from a two-chip design to a single-chip implementation produces substantial cost benefits . 
in addition , atheros has reduced the rest of bom ( bill-of-materials ) by almost num % . 
atheros achieved this integration without sacrificing the performance of the product-which is a major accomplishment . 
this highly integrated design will enable manufacturers to offer 802.11g-based consumer residential gateways at mass-market price points , while still delivering the industry 's best throughput and range. 
atheros launches single chip supporting all three modes . 
atheros launched a single chip supporting all three modes last month . 
but a chip called the unifi-1 from uk bluetooth pioneer cambridge silicon radio could have a greater impact because it is designed to add tri-mode wifi to mobile phones and pdas . 
there will be more on this chip in next month 's personal computer world/ the atheros design comes in two flavours , the ar5413 and ar5414 , which differ only in that the latter supports a proprietary 105mbits/sec mode , with a claimed real throughout of around 60mbits/sec . 
they come with modules called , respectively , the ar5006sx and r5006sx , which are small enough to fit on a mini-pci or pc card . 
they should ship this year , integrate a media access controller ( mac ) , a 2.4/5ghz transceiver , and a baseband processor . 
they also need fewer passive peripheral components than previous designs . 
wifi 11a has a lower range than 11g - that is , data rates drop off more sharply with distance. 
atheros communications launches smart-antenna wireless chipset delivering mimo performance to standard num products . 
atheros communications inc . 
introduced the new ar5005vl wireless solution that employs multiple-radio , smart-antenna technologies to deliver mimo ( multiple-input , multiple-output ) performance and industry-leading throughput to standard num wlan products . 
the ar5005vl chipset uses phased array beamforming , cyclic delay diversity , and optimal receive combining to deliver higher performance even when the new chipset is only on one end of a wireless connection . 
the new chipset therefore enables breakthrough performance with maximum compatibility for the millions of wi-fi products in the market . 
the ar5005vl chipset is available in both 802.11g and 802.11a/g versions , supporting configurations with up to four antennas. 
belkin launches wireless a + g networking line incorporating atheros communication 's dual-band chipset technology . 
atheros communications inc . 
announced that its dual-band 802.11a/g technology is featured in belkin 's new wireless a + g networking line . 
atheros ' popular super ag ( r ) performance-enhancement features are supported in the belkin wireless a + g line . 
super ag employs multiple techniques including dynamic turbo with adaptive radio technology , packet bursting , fast frames , and data compression , to dramatically increase the throughput and range of wireless networking products . 
the belkin wireless a + g line also incorporates atheros ' extended range technology , atheros xr ( tm ) , which provides more stable and reliable network connections in heavy wireless environments. 
lenovo selects atheros as wireless lan technology provider . 
atheros communications announced that lenovo group limited has integrated atheros ' high-performance , single-chip 802.11g solution into new wireless-enabled laptops that will be sold in china and other markets . 
the chip integrates an entire 802.11g solution media access controller ( mac ) , baseband processor , high-performance num ghz radio , and many discrete components in an integrated low-cost digital cmos ( complementary metal-oxide semiconductor ) design.
